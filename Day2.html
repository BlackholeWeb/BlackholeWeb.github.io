    <h1>~Day 2: Progress and Setbacks</h1>

    <p><i>Making Web Pages:</i>
          I started to create multi-pages for my blog site. I learned how to
          connect the pages with links. We also learned about computer's use of
          binary language, only with two numbers: 0 and 1! Gunner the Dog was
          crying also, because he lost his bone. He was so cute. I also added
          margins, color, and changed the font of my new site. However, I forgot
          to save my progress in this class, but eventually recovered in other
          classes.

    <p><i>Coding For Games 1:</i>
        I started to make player controls with the UFO. Using the up, down, left
        and right arrow keys, the UFO can move in any direction. We also played
        with variables like speed, to adjust our game 'difficulty.' Immediately
        after, we began to make collisions with the background and the UFO, so
        the spaceship wouldn't fly off the entire screen. :/ We also fixed some
        camera issues, creating a movement so it would track the UFO's moves.

    <p><i>Musical Robots 1:</i>
        We began the class with the creation of our frets to place on the top of
        our wooden 'guitar.' Using hammers, pliers, and mallets, it took up most
        of our second day. We even ran out of frets because everyone was
        using them at the same time! After that, I began creating the top of
        the guitar with custom sound holes on the edges. What a day. :)
