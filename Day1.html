    <h1>~Day 1: The Basics</h1>
    <p class = "Paragraph" >Arrived around 9:15 am.
      After registration, I took a basic tour around the entire facility. Next,
      students were directed toward a huge room with many other students. After
      playing with beatboxing and meeting new faces, groups split up and I
      followed others to a different classroom. Here's where the fun began.</p>

      <i class = "Paragraph" >Making Web Pages:</i>
      <p class = "Paragraph" >Our class was small, roughly about 12 kids in the room, plus a cute doggy. We
      began to experience and learn about the process of the web and how it works.
      In a few seconds, we were able to create our own <b>HTML</b> sites; the one
      you are reading right now. :)
    </p>

    <p class = "Paragraph" ><i>Coding For Games 1:</i>
      Great start for Day 1. I began to work on the background of my 2D UFO
      Game. I also added and imported a bunch of pre-made assets for the space
      adventure. We began to code at the last second. Oh man!
    </p>

    <p class = "Paragraph" >
      <i>Musical Robots 1:</i>
      To start, our teacher, Byron, gave a quick introduction about the project.
      We started to use a new 3D program, Fusion 360. I began to model a headstock
      for the custom wooden guitar.
