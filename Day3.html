    <h1>~Day 3: Getting Perfection</h1>

    <p><i>Making Web Pages:</i>
        I started to create a better website. We started by using backgrounds.
        With the functions repeat-x and repeat-y, I was able to find the perfect
        background for my blog site. I also looked up some buttons online and put
        them into my blog site. I had to change a few colors based on the new
        background, but it looks good! Also, we made a test-preview of Google
        Maps using html files and inside scripts using Java Script.

        In today's class, we began to create multiple pickup items for my UFO
        game. Throughout the class, I played with the duplication function to
        create more pickups and more player-controlled UFOs! Amazing. Using
        Unity's physics 2D, I created collisions and a count for the pickups.
        The object of this tiny game is to collect all 12 pellets. I also played
        around with the UI text in unity. Awesome.

        Time to get our hands dirty. I began assembling the top and neck of the
        guitar by using glue and snapping the wood pieces in place, just like a
        puzzle. It looks so cool. I imagined myself strumming the strings on the
        fretboard. Although I snapped the board in half; it looks fine because I
        snapped it in place using a clamp. =)
