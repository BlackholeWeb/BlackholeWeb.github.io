    <p><i>Making Web Pages:</i>
        We finished our test with Google maps, as you can see underneath this
        post. I was also working on the previous pages and adding more
        content and anchors for the other pages. The blog is looking excellent so
        far.
    <h2>Using Google Maps</h2>
    <div id="mapcanvas"></div>
    <script>

     var map;
     var geocoder = new google.maps.Geocoder();
     var address = "12067 East Gold Dust, Scottsdale, AZ 85259";
     var geocodeOptions = {
       address: address
     }

     geocoder.geocode( geocodeOptions, addressCallback);

    function addressCallback( results, status ) {
      if (status == google.maps.GeocoderStatus.OK ) {
        var location = results[0].geometry.location;

        var mapDiv = document.getElementById("mapcanvas");
        var mapOptions = {
          zoom: 15,
          center: location,
          mapTypeId: google.maps.MapTypeId.ROADMAP
        };
        map = new google.maps.Map (mapDiv, mapOptions);
      }
    }
    </script>




    <p><i>Coding for Games 1:</i>
        Today, we created many other features for my game. We added sound effects
        (victory, coin, and bounce) to further the gaming experience. I also
        added a timer for completion, until the game resets the board again.
        In addition, I created my first build and tested it on the Mac.

    <p><i>Musical Robots 1:</i>
          Finally, almost completed the instrument. Since the fretboard was a bit
          too wide, we had to sand off a few inches. My hand hurt so much from
          sanding everything. From the neck and the fretboard to the headstock
          and bottom, I used 2 sanding blocks. Right after, I connected the
          bottom and tops of the body. I hope we can finish everything on time
          tomorrow. :)
